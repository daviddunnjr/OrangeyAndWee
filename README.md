# File Name Patterns

**API files** should be named with a combination number separated by an underscore. The first number represents the author, and the second number represents their post number. This prevents multiple authors from accidentally overwriting eachother's posts.

*Examples:*

- `0_1.json` >> Admin's first post
- `1_1.json` >> Admin's wife's first post
- `2_1.json` >> Orangey's first post
- `3_1.json` >> Wee's first post

**Image files** should be named with the author number followed by an underscore, followed by any unique name.

- `0_logo.png` >> Admin's logo image
- `2_liverpool.png` >> Orangey's Liverpool image
